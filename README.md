# DiamondPriceprediction---Machine-Leaarning

### Introduction About the Data :

**The dataset** The goal is to predict `price` of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including `id`):

* `id` : unique identifier of each diamond
* `carat` : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
* `cut` : Quality of Diamond Cut
* `color` : Color of Diamond
* `clarity` : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
* `depth` : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
* `table` : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
* `x` : Diamond X dimension
* `y` : Diamond Y dimension
* `x` : Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:
* `price`: Price of the given Diamond.






Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge appear to perform similarly in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2 score. They provide relatively accurate predictions and explain a significant portion of the variance in the data.
Elastic Net has a higher RMSE and MAE and a slightly lower R2 score, suggesting that it may not perform as well as the other models in this specific context.
The choice of the best model may depend on other considerations such as interpretability, feature importance, and computational efficiency. Further evaluation and possibly hyperparameter tuning may be necessary to make a final model selection.
